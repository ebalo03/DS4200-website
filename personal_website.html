    <h1>About Me, Eva</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Eva. I’m a 4th year, Data Science and Economics major at Northeastern University. I graduate in the spring, but I still have 3 classes I need to take this summer. During my time in college, I studied abroad at Yonsei University in South Korea and I finished my last co-op in the fall. In my free time, I enjoy photography, knitting, cooking, exercise, and long walks. I also really enjoy trying new food places, so I usually try a new restaurant whenever I eat out. 
    </p>

    For spring break, I recently went to Mardi Gras in New Orleans with some friends. It was really fun, and it was nice to be in a warm city. We tried lots of Creole food and interesting dishes, such as frog legs and alligator. My favorite part of the trip was the swamp tour we went on. Here is a picture of a New Orleans swamp:
