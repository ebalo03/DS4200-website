    <h2>More on Mardi Gras</h2>
    <p>
        Mardi Gras, which means "Fat Tuesday" in French, is a famous annual celebration held primarily in New Orleans, Louisiana. It marks the culmination of Carnival season, a period of feasting and revelry before the season of Lent in Christianity. Mardi Gras is a lively, colorful festival known for its parades, balls, costumes, and vibrant street parties.

        The festivities officially begin on Twelfth Night (January 6) and continue through Fat Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday. The highlight is the grand parades, where krewes (organized groups) decorate elaborate floats and throw beads, coins, and other trinkets to the crowds. People wear costumes, often donning masks and feathers, and participate in spirited dances.
